# 2017 Goals Repo

So, I doubt anyone is reading this... but if you made your way here somehow then you've found my repo for tracking my goals for this upcoming year.
2016 was a great year for me.  I finished a bootcamp and got a great job, I was invited to teach for Tech Talent South, I started a great relationship, and so much more.
2017 needs to be just as great and needs to catch me up on some sacrifices I made in the previous year.

Specifically:
Weight Loss,
Strength/Athletic Training,
and Side Projects

These are all things that have been important to me in the past, but have all fallen to the wayside due to work/relationships/laziness

As part of my devotion to be in the open source community, I decided to throw this online as well.
I am planning to continuously update this repo with my progress made in each subject.

Here's to a good year!
